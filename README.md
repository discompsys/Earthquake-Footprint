# Earthquake-Footprint
Source code and other files for the earthquake prediction software.

You can use the licas_ai.jar file in the repository or download a latest one from the sourceforge licas web site.
This provides the FrequencyGrid and the logger, for example.
There are two test classes - TestEQ_Greece and TestEQ_USA. 
You only need to run the ReadData.formatData statement once, then you can comment it out.
You should use the data files provided, but they are the same as the sources and you can easily create new ones, just the header information.
Some of the data rows are not complete, so if there is an error message indicating this when you run the code, just ignore it.
